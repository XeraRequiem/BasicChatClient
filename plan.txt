(1) LogosNet is like an online chat room, with some differences. It will be 
hosted by a server, and then clients can connect to the server as either a 
participant or an observer. When a participant connects, they will give a 
username and then they will be able to send messages of less than 1000 
characters. They can choose to send a message to everyone or a specific user (by 
using @username). Up to 255 participants can connect. When an observer connects, 
they will choose which participant they want to connect to, and then they will 
see all the messages sent and recieved by that participant. Up to 255 observers 
can connect. 

(2) We anticipate that there will be difficulty with getting every message to 
the correct place(s), and only to the correct place(s). 

(3) If we get stuck, we will consult our lecture notes, the textbook, the 
professor's office hours, or Google.
